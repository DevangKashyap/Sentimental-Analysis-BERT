Project Spotlight: Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Restaurant Reviews using BERT 
NLP project where I worked on analyzing restaurant reviews from Yelp to understand customer feedback using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) — one of the most powerful models in NLP today.

Objective:
To automatically classify Yelp reviews as positive, negative, or neutral — helping businesses gain deeper insights into customer sentiments.

What I Did:
Collected and cleaned Yelp restaurant review data using beautiful soup.
Applied preprocessing techniques: tokenization, stopword removal, padding, etc.
Leveraged the pre-trained BERT model for fine-tuning on the review dataset
Achieved high accuracy with strong context-aware understanding of reviews

Why BERT?
Unlike traditional models, BERT captures the context of words in both directions, making it perfect for detecting subtle tones and emotions in feedback.

Outcome:
The model helps in understanding customer experience trends, identifying problem areas in restaurant services, and potentially improving business decisions.
This project deepened my interest in Natural Language Processing and gave me hands-on experience with transformer-based architectures.
